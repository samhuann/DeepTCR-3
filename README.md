## Deep Learning Methods for Parsing T-Cell Receptor Sequencing (TCRSeq) Data

**DeepTCR Torch** is a modern refactor of [DeepTCR](https://github.com/sidhomj/DeepTCR), originally developed by **J.W. Sidhom**. This updated version is built using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, providing a modular, scalable framework for supervised and unsupervised deep learning on T-cell receptor sequencing (TCRSeq) data.

It supports sequence- and repertoire-level analysis, paired Î±/Î² chain inputs, V/D/J gene usage, and optional HLA allele context â€” maintaining functional parity with the original DeepTCR while leveraging a more modern and flexible architecture.

While DeepTCR Torch will run with CPU-only PyTorch installations, for optimal training performance we recommend using a GPU-enabled environment with **CUDA**, **cuDNN**, and **PyTorch with GPU support**.
